Welcome to your new favorite Flask skeleton!


The bare minimum number of files you will need for a Flask app that uses Jinja
templating and a virtual environment will be:

application.py
static/
    styles.css
templates/
    base.html
    homepage.html 
    form-result.html

requirements.txt
env/
.gitignore


** In this case, the form appears on your homepage, but it could easily appear
   in another page.
